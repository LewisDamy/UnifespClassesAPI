# Unifesp Course Catalog Platform

 **Brief disclaimer:**
 - This is a practice project that covers:
     - Developing API
     - Coding with Django Framework
     - Using technology to solve real-life problems

 <p>
 I started this project to learn new technologies, improve coding skills in Python (more
 specifically with [Django REST Framework](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework), ORM & API. This is a continuation of the
 [UnifespTables](https://github.com/LewisDamy/Tabelas_de_UCs_Unifesp) project.
 The focus here is to demonstrate the
 power of Django as a backend framework, while learning about and starting
 my first open-source project tha focuses on building a better system to help Unifesp students
 when selecting their subjects in each semester.
